Consumer_Complaints_Machine_Learning

Objectives:

The CFPB, U.S. government agency dedicated to making sure consumers are treated fairly by banks, lenders, and other financial institutions.  It also maintains a public database of consumer complaints related to financial products and services, which can be used to inform policy decisions and regulatory actions. The objective of the project is to develop predictive models using historical complaint data to forecast timely response rates, response types, and customer satisfaction levels, while ensuring scalability, deployment readiness, and continuous improvement.

1.	Timely Response Prediction:
•	Develop a classification model using historical complaint submissions and response times data to predict whether future complaints will receive a timely response.
 
2.	Response Type Prediction:
•	Train a classification model to categorize the company's response types based on historical data, enabling the prediction of likely responses for new complaints.
3.	Satisfaction Score Prediction:
•	Apply sentiment analysis, NLP, and clustering techniques to analyze the textual content of consumer complaints and predict overall satisfaction scores. Positive sentiments may indicate higher satisfaction, while negative sentiments may suggest dissatisfaction.
4.	Model Training:
•	Implement machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression, Gradient Boosted Tree Regression, and Decision Tree Classifier to build predictive models for item price and event-type prediction.
5.	Model Evaluation and Learning:
•	Learn how to evaluate and compare the performance of regression and classification models using appropriate metrics and techniques.
6.	Integration and Deployment:
•	Integrate the trained models into a cohesive system for real-time prediction of item prices, event types, response times, response types, and customer satisfaction scores.
7.	Hands-On Experience:
•	Gain practical experience in building, training, evaluating, and deploying regression and classification models for solving real-world business problems in the consumer complaint domain.
